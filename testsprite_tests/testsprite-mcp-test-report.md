## Auto-Correct Repeat Functionality Analysis

### Current Implementation Strengths:
1. **Form Validation:** Strong Zod-based validation system
2. **File Handling:** Robust upload validation and error correction
3. **Authentication:** Secure session management with auto-correction
4. **UI Components:** Consistent validation across all forms

### Areas for Improvement:

### Recommended Implementations:

#### 1. Property Creation Templates
```javascript
// Suggested implementation
const PropertyTemplate = {
  saveAsTemplate: (propertyData) => {
    localStorage.setItem('propertyTemplate', JSON.stringify(propertyData));
  },
  loadTemplate: () => {
    return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('propertyTemplate') || '{}');
  },
  applyTemplate: (formRef) => {

    formRef.current.reset(template);
  }
};
```

#### 2. Smart Auto-Correction Service
```javascript
// Suggested implementation
const AutoCorrectService = {
  formatAddress: (address) => {
    // Implement address standardization
    return standardizeAddress(address);
  },
  formatCurrency: (amount, currency = 'USD') => {
    // Auto-format currency with proper symbols
    return new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', {
      style: 'currency',
      currency: currency
    }).format(amount);
  },
  suggestPropertyName: (location) => {
    // Generate property name suggestions based on location
    return generatePropertySuggestions(location);
  }
};
```

#### 3. Repeat Operations Manager
```javascript
// Suggested implementation
const RepeatManager = {
  recordOperation: (operation, data) => {
    const history = this.getHistory();
    history.unshift({ operation, data, timestamp: Date.now() });
    localStorage.setItem('operationHistory', JSON.stringify(history.slice(0, 50)));
  },
  repeatLastOperation: () => {
    const history = this.getHistory();
    if (history.length > 0) {
      return history[0];
    }
    return null;
  },
  getFrequentOperations: () => {
    // Return most frequently used operations for quick access
    return this.getHistory()
      .reduce((acc, op) => {
        acc[op.operation] = (acc[op.operation] || 0) + 1;
        return acc;
      }, {});
  }
};
```
