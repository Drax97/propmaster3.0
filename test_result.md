# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "🔧 SCHEMA CACHE FIX TESTING COMPLETED: Schema cache fix API implemented and functional - GET/POST endpoints working correctly to detect and attempt PGRST205 fixes.

Save changes functionality continues using fallback simulation. REQUIRES MANUAL SUPABASE DASHBOARD INTERVENTION to refresh schema cache."

    message: "🎯 FOCUSED SAVE CHANGES TESTING COMPLETED: 2/4 tests passed (50% success rate). ✅ SAVE CHANGES API FUNCTIONALITY WORKING: PUT /api/admin/users/[userId] endpoint properly accepts role updates, API returns correct updated user data in response format, Invalid data handling works appropriately. ❌ CRITICAL PERSISTENCE ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Role changes do NOT persist to database due to Supabase schema cache issue (PGRST205). DETAILED FINDINGS: API successfully processes role update requests (pending → viewer), Response shows updated role correctly, BUT verification fetch shows original role unchanged (persistence failed). ROOT CAUSE: Same PGRST205 'Could not find table public.users in schema cache' error blocking all database write operations. SOLUTION REQUIRED: Supabase schema cache refresh needed to enable actual database persistence. Save Changes functionality works at API level but cannot write to database."

DETAILED FINDINGS: Schema cache fix API properly implemented with comprehensive diagnostics, Multiple automated refresh methods attempted but schema remains in 'pgrst205_error' state, User role updates continue using fallback simulation instead of real database writes, API correctly identifies problem and provides recommendations. ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED: Supabase schema cache requires manual refresh in dashboard - automated API methods insufficient. RECOMMENDATION: Manual Supabase dashboard intervention needed to resolve persistent PGRST205 errors and enable real database persistence for save changes functionality."
